# llvm-mos-sdk: 6502 platform libraries (crt0, linker scripts, per-target
# clang configs) built with the freshly built mos-clang.

# The SDK's CMake normally *downloads* a prebuilt llvm-mos compiler
# (cmake/bootstrap-compiler.cmake) when it can't find one. Passing
# -DLLVM_MOS=${llvm-mos} makes cmake/find-mos-compiler.cmake pick up our
# Nix-built compiler and skips every network path — required in the sandbox.

  # llvm-mos ships libclang_rt.builtins.a with its symbol index stored as a
  # stray *regular* `/` member (a normal archive keeps `/` as metadata, never a
  # member). That non-standard layout breaks the SDK's `llvm-ar qL` merge step
  # (cmake/merge-libraries.cmake): the stray `/` corrupts the merged archive and
  # the index rebuild dies with "'/': The end of the file was unexpectedly
  # encountered". Normalize the runtime archives (drop the stray index member,
  # rebuild a proper one) in a lightweight symlink overlay so llvm-mos itself
  # isn't rebuilt — only the SDK's archive merges need this; rustc, which uses
  # the Rust compiler_builtins crate for MOS, never touches libclang_rt.
