/// The suggestion is the `cargo xtask <verb>` form rather than the shorter
/// `cargo x<verb>`: the short form is a shim the `nix develop` shell puts on
/// PATH, so outside that shell it does not exist and cargo answers "no such
/// subcommand". `cargo xtask` is a plain alias that always resolves, and it
/// reports the missing toolchain itself. The alias resolves `--manifest-path`
/// against the cwd, so the message names the directory to run it from.
///
/// This is a warning rather than a prompt because a build script has no
/// terminal: its stdin reads EOF immediately and its stderr is captured to
/// `target/*/build/*/stderr` rather than shown. `cargo::warning=` is the only
/// channel cargo surfaces on a successful build.
///
/// Cargo exposes no "what did the user type" variable, so we read the parent
/// process's command line — the build script is spawned directly by cargo. If
/// that lookup fails we stay silent rather than guess.
///
/// Naming the verb requires this script to run on the build being warned about.
/// Cargo otherwise caches build script output and replays it, so the message
/// would keep naming `cargo rustc` long after the user moved on to `cargo run`.
/// Hence the rerun-if-changed on a path that does not exist, emitted by the
/// caller: cargo re-runs the script whenever a declared path is missing. That
/// costs a recompile of this crate per build — paid only on host builds, which
/// are the mistake this warns about, because build script output is cached per
/// target and the caller emits the directive on the host path alone. Builds for
/// a Commodore machine keep their caching.
