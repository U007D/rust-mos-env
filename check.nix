# checks.<system>.c64-hello-world: fully offline, verify that
#   * the toolchain's mos ABI is intact — `c_uint` is 16-bit, asserted at compile
#     time by a probe this check writes below. The probe lives here, not in any
#     project's source: the mos ABI is a property of the build environment, and
#     no project should have to carry the environment's own test;
#   * the two llvm-mos bugs the repo works around are still present — see
#     expect_broken below. When a bug is fixed upstream the check FAILS, naming
#     the workaround to delete, so a stale workaround cannot outlive its cause.
#     Nix re-runs this check when its inputs change, so the signal arrives on the
#     toolchain bump that fixes the bug;
#   * the bundled example (bin/hello-world) builds to a C64 PRG whose first two
#     bytes are the $0801 load address (01 08) the SDK's C64 link step emits
#     ahead of the BASIC SYS stub.
#
# Offline story — three vendor trees, since the sandbox has no network:
#   * compiler_builtins(mos-0.1.148, rev-pinned) and the crates.io deps of the
#     rust-mos workspaces come from rust-mos-src's captured vendor tree/config;
#   * compiler_builtins(mos-0.1.150) — injected by the forked cargo into every
#     -Zbuild-std resolution — comes from check-vendor;
#   * c64_pac and the example's own crates.io deps come from example-vendor.
